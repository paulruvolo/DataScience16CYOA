# CYOA Project Proposal
Anne and Casey

###What dataset you are planning to work with
Rotten Tomatoes

###Who your partner is
Anne LoVerso and Casey Alvarado

###For each group member: what are you hoping to learn from this project?  These goals could be specific data manipulation skills, software engineering skills, or communication skills.
_Anne_: I’m looking forward to a couple things in this project.  I think that doing the Rotten Tomatoes dataset will allow us a lot more open-endedness in creating columns for our model to learn from, because it will leave us open to learn more about data manipulation, in order to create new columns.  Also, I’d love to learn something about data visualization and thinking of interesting ways to communicate our results.  And as a general goal, I’d like to work on making my iPython notebooks better - more readable and modular, and more presentable to the outside world.  I didn’t try very hard on this in the Warmup Project and I’d like to improve here.

_Casey_: I am interested in learning how the data tells a story. Previously, the data science was all about answering yes or no questions and I am interested to explore more open ended questions. I am looking forward to interpreting the data and using various plotting tools to accomplish this goal. I am also hoping to learn how to visualize the data better. I am hoping to gain more experience with which types of graph are the best for which types of stories. Additionally, I was also not super motivated to keep my data clean and I think working with a partner and this amazing data set will help me become motivated. I am so excited to work with movie ratings and sentiment analysis. 

###How do you foresee this project fulfilling the learning goals identified above.  Be specific.  If there are adjustments that could be made to bring things into better alignment, let me know (I won't guarantee that I will allow it, but it's worth a discussion).
We think that working with a partner on this project will help with a lot of things - keeping our code readable and organized, and also allowing us to bounce ideas off each other and figure out new ways to approach the model. Both of us are excited about this data set because we love movies and want to enhance our machine learning skills. We think this dataset will give interesting opportunities for analysis - figuring out different ways to turn words into numbers, and what variables we can pull from just raw text statements.
