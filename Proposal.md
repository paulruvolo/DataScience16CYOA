# Project Proposal and Learning Goals
###### Jacob Kingery and Victoria Preston

We will be working with the San Francisco Crime dataset.

The team consists of Jacob and Victoria.

Jacob's learning goals are to visualize the data well and use Jupyter notebooks effectively.  This dataset lends itself to exploring visualizations because of its spatialty, and getting practice in using Jupyter notebooks will occur regardless of the dataset used.

Victoria's learning goals are to learn how to effectively visualize raw data and processed data spatially (i.e. generate a mapping for predictions which could be widely accesible to a variety of audiences). In addition, she is hoping to practice effective research techniques in which social factors about the data would be learned which could ultimately inform the methodology of generating the predictions for the dataset. The temporal nature of the data will play an interesting role in this analysis as well.
This project should be able to fulfill these goals in that the data is naturally spatial and the datatypes presented lend itself to mapping (either geographically by precinct or temporally by season or year). Additionally, given the nature of crime, the social aspects of this data are going to be extremely relevant to both senstive handling/processing of the data, and developing intuition on ways in which to explore the data for stronger analysis.
