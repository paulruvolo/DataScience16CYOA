# DataScience16CYOA
This is the base repo for the CYOA project for Data Science at Olin College, Spring 2016.

We worked on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. Our overall story is located in the Overall_Story_final.ipynb on the master branch. Our final writeups for data exploration and our two model iterations are also in the master branch. 

The packages we used for this project can all be installed via pip or come with Anaconda's distribution of Python. They are as follows:
* sklearn
* numpy
* re
* nltk
* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* cPickle
* string
* collections
 
All previous iterations can be found on the old_versions branch.
