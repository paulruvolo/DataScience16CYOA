# Dataset:
We are planning to work with the SF Crime dataset.

# Team:
We (Mac-I and Sophia) are working together!

# Learning Goals:
## Sophia:
I’d like to use this project to develop more intuition for how to take a dataset and extract useful features to be used for machine learning. I feel like I started learning this in the titanic dataset, and I was impressed by how much extracting new features (like title, for example) can improve the accuracy of a model. I’d like to continue this learning in this project, because I feel like “knowing” what new features would be helpful and understanding how to quickly generate them will make me better at data science, and, additionally, will prove very helpful for SCOPE. 

I’m also interested in learning how to  visualize/understand what a model is doing. I’ve done a little bit of this in various projects that I’ve done in the machine learning space, and I’m curious about how to make a visualization that accurately describes what a model is paying attention to. I’m particularly interested in this because I find data visualization, and particularly thinking about what makes for a helpful visualization a particularly interesting part of data science. As far as this goe  s, I think I’ll investigate visualization tools like heat maps for the data visualization part, and when we actually implement models, create visualizations to clue me in as to what the model is doing. 

## Mac-I:
I would like to learn about machine learning approaches for temporal data. This ties in with some of my initial learning desires of predicting future events based on past data. I see this goal tying very nicely with the project since it is a data set largely based on time and location of an event. I would also like to learn more about how to identify key features that would help a machine learning algorithm, besides simply looking at correlations, or seeing coefficients produced by the algorithm. I think this would make me a better data scientist and make the process more interesting. I think that this project will help me achieve this goal by giving me more experience looking at a new dataset. 

# Learning goals and this Project:
For the most part, we think that our learning goals fit nicely within the first learning objective: 
 
*“A major focus of this course is iteration.  By taking a second spin through Kaggle, you will get another chance to explore machine learning within the friendly learning environment of Kaggle.  Through this new opportunity, you will begin to develop generalizable lessons about both tools and process for successfully doing machine learning.”*

Our learning goals mostly have to do with developing intuition about machine learning, in various stages of the process. As a result, frequent iteration will help us develop intuition about what sorts of features are helpful and how to work with temporal/spatial data. For these learning goals, we don't think that we will need/want to modify the project to achieve them.

Similarly, to learn more about the role of visualization in developing an understanding of various models and what they focus on, we will also engage in a similar pattern of iteration and (hopefully) improvement. Here, we plan to investigate different ways of visualizing the data that we are not familiar with in python, such as heat maps, and come back to the data visualization/exploration portion of the project as we try different features and/or models. Similarly, we are not necessarily sure what a helpful visualization of the model itself will look like. We, however, believe that with enough iteration and seeing how others have visualized what models are focusing on, we will be able to visualize model performance in a way that is helpful to us.
